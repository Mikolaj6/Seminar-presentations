## Warta, or not?

This project is about predicting whether a website is about Warta as an insurance company, or something else. It contains 
scraper for getting website contents, as well as Jupyter notebook scripts for training and making predictions. I use
ROBERTA as my main model and XGBoost for reference. In the presentation I look into how transformers, 
BERT and ROBERTA work and what are some more rudimentary approaches to this kind of problems.
